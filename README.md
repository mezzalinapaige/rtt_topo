## This is the companion repository for *Evolutionary rate variation among lineages in gene trees has a negative impact on species-tree inference*
### Mezzalina P. Vankan, Simon Y.W. Ho, David A. Duchene.

It contains the gene trees estimated using trimmed alignments from each of the 30 datasets, the branch metrics (e.g. co-efficient of variation in root-to-tip distances) for each gene tree, and all R code used in this study.

Specifically:

*functions.R* All R functions used in this study.

#### Data

*maxtax.genetrees.Rdata* An R data file containing gene trees estimated using the trimmed alignments (based on the maximum number of taxa and maximum number of loci) from all 30 datasets (*n* = 34,662). 

*genetree.branch.metrics.csv* A data table containing the branch metrics from each of the gene-trees across all datasets. This table was used in the linear regression analysis.
