This repository is associated with the article 'Phylogenetic signal is associated with the degree of variation in root-to-tip distances.'

It contains the R code and tree files that were used in the analysis:

1. MaximalTrs - code used to run estimate gene trees with maximal number of taxa.
2. updated.all.trees.Rdata contains 36,075 gene trees from the 34 studies, estimated using above code.
3. data_extractionRTT - extract branch length metrics, gene distance and species distance (RF.dist).
4. data_analysisRTT - code that ran glm analysis and plotted t-statistics.
