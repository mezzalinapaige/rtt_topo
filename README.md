## This is the companion repository for *Evolutionary rate variation among lineages in gene trees has a negative impact on species-tree inference*
### by Mezzalina P. Vankan, Simon Y.W. Ho, David A. Duchene.

This respository contains the trimmed DNA sequence alignments used in this study for each of the 30 datasets, gene trees estimated using these alignments, and the branch metrics (e.g. coefficient of variation in root-to-tip distances) for each gene tree.

Specifically:

*functions.R* All R functions used in this study.

#### Data

*maxtax.alignments.zip* A zipped file of alignments from all 30 datasets that have been trimmed to maximise the number of taxa and number of loci

*maxtax.genetrees.Rdata* An R data file containing gene trees estimated using the maxtax alignments from all 30 datasets (*n* = 34,662). 

*genetree.branch.metrics.csv* A data table containing the branch metrics from each of the gene-trees across all datasets. This table was used in the linear regression analysis.
