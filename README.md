This repository is associated with the article 'Phylogenetic signal is associated with the degree of variation in root-to-tip distances.'

It contains the R code and tree files used in the analysis:

Rerun code should return results similar to those seen in the paper. However, due to the large numbers of taxa and loci, Astral may estimate a slightly different species tree to that in our study. Whilst this should not change overall trends, it may return slightly different values to that seen in Table 2 in the supplementary material.
