## This is the companion repository for *Evolutionary rate variation among lineages in gene trees has a negative impact on species-tree inference*
### by Mezzalina P. Vankan, Simon Y.W. Ho, David A. Duchene.

This respository contains the gene trees estimated using trimmed alignments from each of the 30 datasets, the branch metrics (e.g. coefficient of variation in root-to-tip distances) for each gene tree, and all R code used in this study.

Specifically:

*functions.R* All R functions used in this study.

#### Data

*maxtax.genetrees.Rdata* An R data file containing gene trees estimated using the maxtax alignments from all 30 datasets (*n* = 34,662). 

*genetree.branch.metrics.csv* A data table containing the branch metrics from each of the gene-trees across all datasets. This table was used in the linear regression analysis.
